# BlogYourWay

This is a hobby project, for creating a self-hosted blogging service to **host posts, project showcases at the same place**.

It is built with Flask and Bootstrap 5, along with some useful javascript libraries, such as [easy-markdown-editor](https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor).

I am also considering migrate to FastAPI.
